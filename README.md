# awesome-books-articles

A list of awesome books, articles and websites of several subjects like mathematical logic, type theory, categories theory.

## Mathematical logics.

* Le point aveugle, Jean Yves Girard. In French. Proof theory, sequent calculus, linear logic, Curry Howard Correspondence, System F. In two volumes.

## Type theory.


### To begin.
* [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).
  Known as TAPL. From the untyped lambda-calculus to System F-omega with simply
  typed lambda calculus, System F, System F sub, subtyping. Very good
  introduction about type theory for a developer and with a theoretical point of
  view.
* [MPRI 2.4 Course about type systems](http://gallium.inria.fr/~remy/mpri/).
  Simply typed lambda-calculus, polymorphism, type reconstruction, existantial
  types. Very interesting and some description of logical relations. Very good
  starting course. More theoretical than TAPL.

### Must-read articles

* [On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism](http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/OnUnderstanding.A4.pdf), Luca Cardelli & Peter Wagner. Introduction of System F-sub with the language FUN.
* [Bounded Quantification is Undecidable](http://www2.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/SS07/Typen/pierce93bounded.pdf), Benjamin C. Pierce. In this article, Pierce shows the undecidability of subtyping of System F-sub.

## Category theory and homotopy type theory.

### Courses
* [Lambda-calcul et catégories](https://www.irif.fr/~mellies/mpri-ens.html). In French. Courses of the MPRI. Link between lambda-calculus and categories.

### Books

* [Homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/). Website and books.
  Book to introduce the theory, its purpose its goal.

### Blogs/websites

* [n-category café](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/). About category.
* [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage). About Category and Homotopy type theory.
